/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for WellTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data while allowing public read access to community forum data.
 * User-specific data (habits, mood logs, journal entries, etc.) is only accessible to the authenticated user.
 * Community forum data is publicly readable, but write access to forums and posts is restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/**: All user-specific data.
 * - /community_forums/{communityForumId}: Community forum metadata.
 * - /forum_posts/{forumPostId}: Individual forum posts.
 * - /forum_posts/{forumPostId}/replies/{replyId}: Replies to a specific post.
 * - /library/{resourceId}: Publicly accessible mental health resources.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private.
 * - Community forum data is publicly readable.
 * - Listing of user documents in `/users/{userId}` is allowed only for the owner.
 * - No complex schema validation is enforced during prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts and replies include `userProfileId` to check ownership without additional reads.
